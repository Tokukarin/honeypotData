## Timestamps and IPs of bots/hackers that try to access my server.
#### Data does get updated daily.
### Data is stored in a json file.
#### Most important:
src_ip          - The IPs of the script kiddies, If you read this, feel free to DDoS them.   
timestamp       - Will be used for elasticsearch/grafana to visualize the data later on.   
dest_port       - The Destination Port (ssh is changed to another port and mapped via NAT to 22 externally).   
#### Note to self: create Grafana Dashboard for the data.
